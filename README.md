Steps on how to create a Github Page:
1. Clone the remote repository to your local machine.
2. Change visibility of the repository to Public.
3. Configure GitHub Pages through the settings by selecting which part of the branch you will use to host your static website.

My key takeaways:
- You can use Github pages to easily host a static website directly from your Github repository.
- Flexboxes make creating web pages more easily.
